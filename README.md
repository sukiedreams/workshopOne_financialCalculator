# Financial Calculator

For my project, I created two financial calculators in Java.

The first is a mortgage calculator that takes in the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term to calculate your monthly payment. It's great for getting a quick idea of what a home loan will cost you each month.

The second is a future value calculator for a one-time deposit. It uses compound interest to show how much a CD (Certificate of Deposit) or similar investment will be worth at maturity. It’s a handy tool for planning savings and seeing how your money can grow over time.

Both calculators use user input and Java’s built-in math functions, and I especially enjoyed using switch statements to handle different calculation modes and make the program feel interactive.

Java’s honestly pretty cool—it’s clean, powerful, and just makes sense. I really like using switch statements; they’re super handy and make my code feel organized and smooth.
